## Setup Issues

Quick check: Did anyone face any problems setting up Git on your machine or creating an account on
GitHub?

## What is **version control** and why should you care?

- A **version control system (VCS)** helps to record changes to a file or a set of files over time
- It allows you to revert a project to a previous state, or to compare changes over time
- Acts as an "undo" button for your code and lets your collaborate with your team

---

## What is Git?

- Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 as a replacement for existing VCS for the Linux kernel
- A distributed version control system (DVCS)
- Every commit is a *snapshot* of your files
- GitHub != Git

![](snapshots.svg){.white-bg}

---

## The three \"areas\"

- Working directory: where you actually work
- Index/\"staging\" area: where you construct a commit
- Repository/commit: the repository itself

![](areas.png){.white-bg style="height: 15ex"}

---

## Getting started

In each commit, Git stores the author and committer\'s name and email

You need to configure Git:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

---

## Setting your editor

Git sometimes launches an editor e.g. when you `commit`, to edit the
commit message

Configure your favourite editor:
```
git config --global core.editor nano
git config --global core.editor emacs
# VS Code
git config --global core.editor "code --wait --new-window"
# For Windows
git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -nosession"
git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Microsoft VS Code/code.exe' -n -w"
```

Now, we will create a new repository for this session.

---

## Allowing your local machine to access your GitHub account

This can be done by setting up an SSH key or an HTTPS Personal Access Token (PAT)

---

## Setting up a PAT

PATs are used to provide access to repositories with finer control/settings.

You can learn more about them [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

---

## Cloning the repository

Downloading a local copy of the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/learning-git.git
```
The server (i.e. GitHub) stores the remote copy (like a single source of truth)


---

## Initialising a repository

Let\'s create a new Git repository.

```
$ mkdir my-git-repo
$ cd my-git-repo
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in my-git-repo/.git/
```

---

## Stage a file

Create a new file in `hello.txt`, however you want. Then add it:

```
$ echo 'Hello world' > hello.txt
$ git add hello.txt
```

Staging tells Git that you want to include the file in your next snapshot.

---

## Check the status

We\'ve just staged a file! So what is the state of the repository?

```
$ git status
```

```
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
    (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

    new file:   hello
```

---

## Make your first commit

Committing files is taking the snapshot of the files that have been staged.

```
$ git commit -m "Add hello"
```

```
[master (root-commit) 5d74ce3] Add hello
    1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
    create mode 100644 hello
```

You can leave the `-m ...` part out. Git will open your editor
for you to compose a commit message.

---

## Push your changes to GitHub
After committing your changes, you can now `push` these changes to GitHub
```
$ git push origin main
```
`origin` is a shorthand name for the remote repo that the project was
cloned from. It is used instead of the URL for convenience.


---

## Make some changes, and look at them
Make edits to `hello.txt` (or whatever file you made), then

```
$ git diff
```

```
diff --git a/hello b/hello
index 802992c..5d56d4d 100644
--- a/hello
+++ b/hello
@@ -1 +1 @@
-Hello world
+Hello Hackerschool!
```

`git diff` shows the changes to file content.

---

## Viewing commit history

```
$ git log
```

```

---

## Intermission

5 minutes...

In the meantime, try out the commands that you have learnt! Add new files, edit them,
commit them, and stage them!

---

## Collaborating with others

---

## Collaboration Workflows

1. Branch & PR
2. Fork & PR

This workshop focuses on the former - "Branch & PR"

::: { .font50 }

For more information about "Fork & PR", you [can visit this link here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

:::

## What is a branch?

A branch is an independent line of development, often used for features or bug fixes
that should not be directly and immediately saved onto the main branch

![](./branch.svg)

## What is a branch?

Main branch is the initial and primary place where most development occurs (`main` is traditionally used but can be named anything, used to be known as `master` branch)

## HEAD

`HEAD` is a special name given to the current commit of your current branch for ease of reference

![](head-to-master.png){.white-bg style="height: 20ex;"}

---

## Why use branching?

::: {.font75}

-   work on **different versions of our code simultaneously**. Think of branches as alternative timelines.
-   create separate contexts where we can try new things or even **work on multiple ideas in parallel** without risking the codebase.
-   if feature A and feature B are being developed, if A breaks, it doesn't affect B.

:::

---

## Creating a branch

```
$ git checkout -b new-feature
Switched to a new branch 'new-feature'
```

Alternatively:

```
$ git branch new-feature
$ git checkout new-feature
Switched to branch 'new-feature'
```

---

## Creating a branch

![](branch-1.svg){.white-bg}

---

## Listing branches

```
$ git branch
    main
* new-feature
```

---

## Changing branches

```
$ git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'
```

---

## Branch & PR Workflow

Each member owns their copy of the repository locally (through cloning)

When working on a new feature or bug fix, each member will

---

## Branch & PR Workflow

1. Pull the latest changes from the remote repository
2. Create a branch per feature/bug fix on their local copy
3. Edit the files in their respective branch
4. Push their local branch to the repository
5. Make a pull request of their feature/bug fix branch to the `main` branch (remote copy)

---

## Hands-on Time!

---

## Setup

Add your teammate as a collaborator to your newly created GitHub repository (Settings > Manage access > Invite a collaborator)

![](./collaborator.png)

---

## Setup

Clone their repository onto your machine (name it something different from your own):

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<your teammate's GitHub name>/my-new-repo.git my-friend-repo/
$ cd my-friend-repo/
```

---

## Creating a branch

```
$ git checkout -b feature-1
```

---

## Making your changes

Edit your friend's `hello.txt` to have whatever content you want and then stage and commit the file:

```
$ git add hello.txt
$ git commit -m "Update hello.txt"
```

---

## Pushing local changes to the remote repository

```
$ git push origin feature-1
```
`origin` is a shorthand name for the remote repo that the project was
cloned from. It is used instead of the URL for convenience.

---

## Opening a pull request on the repository

Repository page > Pull Requests > New pull request

![](github-pr-1.png){style="height: 12ex"}

---

## Creating pull request

Ensure that the `compare` branch is your local feature branch and `base` branch
is `main` branch

<!-- TODO: Add updated screenshot -->
![](./pr-page.png)

---

## Creating pull request

Confirm pull request with "Create pull request"

<!-- TODO: Add updated screenshot -->
![](./pr-details.png)

---

## Reviewing pull requests

Your repository > Pull Requests > Select your friend's pull request

![](./view-pr.png)

View the commits and the files changed through the tabs.

---

## Accepting pull requests

If the files are in order, click "Merge pull request" to accept their changes into
your repository's `main` branch

---

## Getting latest remote copy on your local copy

```
git pull origin main
```

`origin` is a shorthand name for the remote repo that the project was
cloned from. It is used instead of the URL for convenience.

---

## Merging

Combining your branch to another branch

![](./merge.png)

---

## Handling (merge) conflicts

Merge conflicts arise when the same line of code is changed across two commits
so there is a conflict in which to be used

---

## Simulating merge conflicts

In your repository, create branch `conflict-1` from `main` and edit the first line of `hello.txt`

```
$ git checkout -b conflict-1
```

Return to `main` and create another branch `conflict-2` from `main` and edit the first line of `hello.txt` again

```
$ git checkout main
$ git checkout -b conflict-2
```

---

## Merge conflicts

![](conflict-1.svg){.white-bg}

---

## Merge conflicts

Now, try to merge `conflict-1` and `conflict-2` into `main`.

```
$ git merge conflict-1
Updating b53e9cf..87a92c3
Fast-forward
    hello.txt | 2 +-
    1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
$ git merge conflict-2
Auto-merging hello.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in hello.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

---

## Handling merge conflicts

```
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
(use "git push" to publish your local commits)

You have unmerged paths.
(fix conflicts and run "git commit")
(use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
(use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

both modified:   hello.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

---

## Handling merge conflicts

```
$ cat hello.txt
<<<<<<< HEAD
Goodbye!
=======
Farewell!
>>>>>>> conflict-2
```

[What we have in `main`]{.mark}

[What we want to merge in `conflict-2`]{.mark-red}

---

## Handling merge conflicts

<!-- TODO: MUST DEMO TO EXPLAIN -->
Edit `hello.txt` as such...

## Ignoring files

Sometimes we don\'t want Git to track a certain file

~~~ {.bash-strong}
$ touch ignore-me
$ git status
~~~
    On branch master
    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        ignore-me

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
---

## Ignoring files

We can add it to `.gitignore`

~~~ {.bash-strong}
$ echo "/ignore-me" >> .gitignore
$ git status
~~~
    On branch master
    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        .gitignore

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

`.gitignore` should be committed.

---

## Ignoring files

~~~ {.bash-strong}
$ git add .gitignore && git commit -m "Add .gitignore"
~~~
    [master 5ada1cf] Add .gitignore
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
     create mode 100644 .gitignore
~~~ {.bash-strong}
$ git status
~~~
    On branch master
    nothing to commit, working tree clean
~~~ {.bash-strong}
$ git status --ignored
~~~
    On branch master
    Ignored files:
      (use "git add -f <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        ignore-me

    nothing to commit, working tree clean

---

## What to ignore?

Typically, we ignore files like build artifacts and generated files that
are usually derived from the human-authored code in the repository. E.g.

-   dependency caches like `/node_modules`
-   compiled code like `.o`, `.pyc` files
-   build output directories like `/bin`, `/out`
-   runtime-generated files like log files
-   personal configuration files e.g. of your IDE

---


## `.gitignore` format

    /logs/*/*.log
    /logs/**/*.log
    **/logs
    **/logs/debug.log
    *.log
    /debug.log
    debug.log

[See the full pattern format.](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format)

---

## HTTPS vs SSH

It doesn\'t really matter.

Use HTTPS if you don\'t have an SSH key set up with GitHub, or if it is
a repository that you cannot write to.

Use SSH if you have an SSH key set up, and you can write to the
repository.

---

## Or it kinda does

::: { .font75 }
Using your GitHub password is no longer allowed after **August 13, 2021**. If you use HTTPS, you'll need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT).

In your GitHub account, go to

`Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Token`

to generate one.

:::

---

## Or does it?

Some enteprise network/universities may block SSH connections. However, you can try using SSH over HTTPS port (443).

    $ ssh -T -p 443 git@ssh.github.com
    > Hi USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not
    > provide shell access.

---

## Or does it?

If you get the success message, you can proceed to set SSH over HTTPS as a default connection by adding this to your `.ssh/config`

    Host github.com
    Hostname ssh.github.com
    Port 443
    User git

---

## Commit message discipline

First line: 80-character title, phrased imperatively

Then if your change is complex, elaborate on the change in prose.

``` font45
Change greeting from "Hi" to "Hello"

"Hi" is a bit too informal for a greeting. We should change it to "Hello" instead,
so that our users don't feel like we are being too informal. Blah blah blah blah.
Blah blah.
```

## Forking and PR setup

Clone this repository:
[fork-me](https://github.com/hackerschool-git/fork-me).

    $ git clone https://github.com/hackerschool-git/fork-me.git
    Cloning into 'fork-me'...
    remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 3 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.

---

## Forking and PR

You\'ve made some improvements, and now you want it upstreamed!

    $ cd fork-me/
    $ nano hello # Edit hello
    $ git add hello && git commit -m "Improve hello"
    [master df48f95] Improve hello
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)

---

## Forking and PR

Fork the repository:

![](github-fork-1.png)

---

## Forking and PR

Get the URL:

![](github-fork-2.png)

---

## Update your repository

Make sure there haven\'t been new changes made to the upstream.

    $ git pull --rebase
    Already up to date.

We use `--rebase` because merge commits are generally frowned-upon in
GitHub-style PRs.

Also merge commits will look extremely funky in your PRs.

---

## Forking and PR

Add the remote, and push

    $ git remote add fork git@github.com:.../fork-me.git

[Randomly chosen from the Linux
kernel.](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=37c0aead7902b1ddf1b668e1ab74c80b9a7fd183)

net_sched: sch_fq: handle non connected flows

FQ packet scheduler assumed that packets could be classified
based on their owning socket.

This means that if a UDP server uses one UDP socket to send
packets to different destinations, packets all land
in one FQ flow.

This is unfair, since each TCP flow has a unique bucket, meaning
that in case of pressure (fully utilised uplink), TCP flows
have more share of the bandwidth.

If we instead detect unconnected sockets, we can use a stochastic
hash based on the 4-tuple hash.

This also means a QUIC server using one UDP socket will properly
spread the outgoing packets to different buckets, and in-kernel
pacing based on EDT model will no longer risk having big rb-tree on
one flow.

Note that UDP application might provide the skb->hash in an
ancillary message at sendmsg() time to avoid the cost of a dissection
in fq packet scheduler.
